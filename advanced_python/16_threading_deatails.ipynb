    "\n",
    "A race condition happened here. A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. Because the thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time, you don't know the order in which the threads will attempt to access the shared data. In our case, the first thread accesses the database_value (0) and stores it in a local copy. It then increments it (local_copy is now 1). With our time.sleep() function that just simulates some time consuming operations, the programm will swap to the second thread in the meantime. This will also retrieve the current database_value (still 0) and increment the local_copy to 1. Now both threads have a local copy with value 1, so both will write the 1 into the global database_value. This is why the end value is 1 and not 2."

Inside the infinite loop the thread is waiting until items are available due to the blocking q.get() call. When items are available, they are processed (i.e. just printed here), and then q.task_done() tells the queue that processing is complete. In the main thread, 10 daemon threads are created. This means that they automatically die when the main thread dies, and thus the worker method and infinite loop is no longer invoked. Then the queue is filled with items and the worker method can continue with available items. At the end q.join() is necessary to block the main thread until all items have been gotten and proccessed."
