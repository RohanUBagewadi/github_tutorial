In our example the two processes have to read the shared value, increase it by 1, and write it back into the shared variable. If this happens at the same time, the two processes read the same value, increase it and write it back. Thus, both processes write the same increased value back into the shared object, and the value was not increased by 2. See https://www.python-engineer.com/learn/advancedpython16_threading/ for a detailed explanation of race conditions."
